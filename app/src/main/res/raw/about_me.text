Hello! My name is Adi, I’m 17 years old and currently in my senior year of high school. I have a twin brother and a little sister who is 4 years old.

Outside of school, I’m a passionate dancer. I train in jazz, modern, lyrical, and ballet four times a week. Dance is a big part of my life, and I regularly take part in competitions and performances.

Another passion of mine is baking. I love spending time in the kitchen, especially when I’m creating beautifully decorated cakes. The combination of creativity, patience, and precision that baking requires really speaks to me.

This love for baking is exactly what inspired me to create this app. I wanted to build something that could bring together my interests in technology and baking,

and help others discover and organize recipes in a simple, beautiful, and personal way. Whether you’re an experienced cook or just starting out, I hope this app brings you joy in the kitchen—just like baking does for me.
